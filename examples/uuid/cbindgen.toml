 * @file uuid.h
 * @brief UUID C API - Generate and manipulate UUIDs
 * 
 * This library provides C bindings for UUID operations using the Rust uuid crate.
 * All functions follow standard C error conventions:
 * - Functions returning pointers return NULL on error
 * - Functions returning bool return false on error
 * - Call uuid_last_error() to get error details after a failure
 * 
 * Memory management:
 * - All returned pointers must be freed with uuid_free()
 * - uuid_free() is safe to call multiple times on the same pointer
